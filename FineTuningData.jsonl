There's a lot in it though and depending on your scene partner's experience level, it might be more than they can comfortably handle.

It doesn't say exactly who you are to each other, but obviously friends of some sort since you know her name and her cookie preferences and also brought her a gift. The gift itself hints at a location (a home) while not defining 100% and does provide an activity, gift giving/food sharing. So part of the base was established plus you established that you like and care about your scene partner wile not falling into any common traps (fighting, questions, problems, etc). Good job!"}]}

This is an engaged couple preparing for their wedding in the wedding venue. You do create an unnecessary problem (you can't hear your betrothed) and solve it with a comedic offer. I like the offer but that's an awful lot for the first line. Depending on your scene partner's experience level, you might want to hold off on adding so much in a first line."}]}

Eh, you're sharing an outhouse so it probably isn't a professional relationship, so I guess we know a little about the Who. Even so, this would be better if it were more collaborative and less conflct oriented."}]}

It's jokey, but I like the joke. It could maybe be a little shorter, but then it is only long because you repeat the comedic offer (speaking in a 1920s Cole Prter kinda way) several times, which is a friendly way to help your scene partner understand your offer. Still I think it is safer and friendlier to hold off on intentionally introducing something funny in your scene's first line."}]}

It starts with a comedic offer (wanting Amish clothes) moves quickly to a second one (steal those clothes for me) that makes your character seem unmoored. Not because demanding someone steal you a gift couldn't be a funny offer, but because it comes on the tail of you establishing a different comedic offer. Too many comedic offers can undercut a scene's integrity and rob it of its chance to be funny."}]}
