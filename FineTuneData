{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation(s) based on the suggestion 'gallon': 'I can drink a gallon of milk every morning,'", "completion": " Your initiation line, 'I can drink a gallon of milk every morning,' sets up a specific and unique character trait and that's about it. You might think it provides a "what" (Drinking milk) but remember this is something that happens in the morning and not now by implication. Here are a few points of feedback: Character & Opinion: You've established a character with a unique habit, which can be explored further but which migt also be too much to handle this early in the scene. Depending on the experience level of your scene partner you might want to consider starting with more mundane elements of the base, instead of only a comedic caracteristic.  Relationship & Setting: The line lacks context about where the scene is happening or the relationship between the characters. Adding these elements can make the initiation more grounded and relatable. Conflict-Free: It's a conflict-free statement, which is good. It leaves room for your scene partner to build on the information. Overall, an interesting start that would probably benefit from more details about the base reality."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the below improv initiation(s) based on the suggestion 'grant': 'I grant you, the walls are 4 feet higher than anticipated.'", "completion": "Your initiation line, 'I grant you, the walls are 4 feet higher than anticipated,' says little about you or scene partner while introducing a kind of boring but specific situatio/discrepancy, which provides a focus for your scene, but a bad one. Your focus should be on your relationship with your scene partner. Here are a few points of feedback: Mundane Specific Situation: You've set up a scenario involving unexpected wall heights, which is unrelated to you and your scene partner and strangely mundane. Maybe adding an opinion about this situation or taking responsibility for it ('I Made These Walls Higher!') could help, but the real trick would be to say something about your scene partner or establish someting about the base reality. Base Reality: The relationship is undefined. Clarifying who the characters are should take precedence over including 'funny' details that create a scenario or problem. The setting is somewhat implied but not explicit. Near walls?  Clearly establishing where this conversation is happening would help ground the scene.  There was no base reality here at all. Overall, this is not a good initiation because you are no closer to being able to easily collaborate on an improv scene with your scene partner after this initiation than you were before it. "

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'hyacinth' : 'What a beautiful garden you have, Susan!'", "completion": "Your initiation line, 'What a beautiful garden you have, Susan!' establishes a positive opinion and hints at a relationship, which is a strong start. Here are a few points of feedback:Positive Relationship: You've introduced a compliment and a name, suggesting familiarity and a positive relationship, which is a good way for your scene to start. Setting: The setting is clear â€“ Susan's garden. This helps to ground the scene effectively by adding an important cornerstone of te base reality. Overall, a lovely and positive initiation with a clear setting and relationship. You might have added other elements, by why fix what isn't broken?"

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'civilian' : 'civilian	I've always thought of myself as a civilian, you should know that if we're going to get married.'", "completion": "Your initiation line sets up a relationship and reveals a significant piece of information, which is a strong start. There's a lot in it thoug and depending on your scene partner's experience level, it might be more than they can comfortably handle. Here are a few points of feedback: Relationship & Opinion: You've established a personal relationship (engagement) and a strong opinion about your own character, which is excellent. It is a kind of funny opinion because it doesn't really fit with getting married. Why would your future spouse need to know you see yourself as a civilian? SO it's surprising, which makes it potentially funny, but it might be too much at the very start of the scene.  Overall, a strong initiation with a clear relationship and personal stake.  Clarifying the setting and adding context could have helped it further, but the big note here is don't worry about being funny immediately. Worry about connecting and collaborating with yor scene partner. A great way to collaborate with your scene partner is to initiate witha line of dialogue they can 'catch' and work with."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'grill' : 'You know how these police interrogations go. I'll grill you for hours if I have to.'", "completion": "Your initiation line sets a clear tone and scenario but introduces the very real temptation of immediate conflict. Here are a few points of feedback: Base Reality: We know where we are, who we are and what is going on, all in one line that isn't a run on or ocerly complicated. BRAVO! Conflict Introduction: A police interrogation is an intense base reality and it might be so 'Loud' that it is hard to collaborate/communicate. This is a great initiation for experienced players who can handle it and a dangerous one for beginners. Suggestion: I was sutrprised to see the word 'grill' pop up when it did. Sometimes we can get a laugh by sneaking the suggestion in an initation or we feel we have to put it into te initiation or larger scene. We don't. It didn't hurt having the suggestion in this initiation, but be careful of worrying about fitting the suggestion into an initiation over establishing a base reality, avoiding conflict, liking your scene partner or any other early scene goal. Overall, great initiation."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'site' : 'Yeah I can definitely see building a greasy spoon dinner on this plot, Harry.'", "completion": "Your initiation line sets up a clear scenario and relationship, which is a solid start. Here are a few points of feedback: Base Reality: You've established a specific location and possibly a professional relationship between the characters, which is great. We know what is going on and while the relationship might go in a few different ways, at least elements of it are defined. Opinion: The line includes a positive vision, showing a clear opinion about the potential of the plot, adding depth to the base reality. Overall, a strong initiation with a clear setting, relationship, and opinion."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'circuit' : 'Here are your morning Meds, Mary. How did you sleep?'", "completion": "Your initiation line provides a clear relationship and setting, establishing a solid foundation. Here are a few points of feedback: Base Reality: The relationship (caregiver and patient) and the setting (likely a home or medical facility, but certainly a bedroom) are immediately clear, which is excellent. Question: The line includes a question and an unnecessary one at that. Yes, 'How did you sleep?' feels torn from the throwaway lines of a thousand movies, which lends the scene a feeling of theatrical truth. But why not just make it a statement? 'You look like you slept well." is much better. Remember questions put your scene partner on the hot seat and often lead to mistakes or unwelcome surprises." Overall, a strong initiation with clear roles and setting. Watch out for those questions!"

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'former' : 'Remember me? We used to work security at Fort Bragg.'", "completion": "Your initiation line provides a shared history (that comes with a relationship) and a hint of nostalgia. Here are a few points of feedback: Shared History: Establishing a past relationship is great, as it gives depth and context to the characters. Question: Uh oh you asked a question. What if your scene partner responded to it with, "No I don't remember you." because the question startled them? Now you don't have the relationship you worked so hard in your initiation to add! Better would be, 'Look who it is! My old security coworker at Fort Bragg!' Base Reality: Mentioning you were once at Fort Bragg isn't the same thing as saying were your scene currently is, but sometimes it can feel similar. We didn't know where this scene was happening, and that was okay, but be aware that the location still needs to be added. Overall, a strong initiation with a clear shared history. The question threatens what is good about it though."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'put' : 'I'm thinking about becoming more off-putting.'", "completion": "Your initiation line is unique and intriguing, but nothing else. That might be enough. Here are a few points of feedback: Opinion & Character: You've established a strong opinion and a unique character goal, which is excellent for driving comedy in the scene. It is happening in the first line though and depending on wo your partner is that might be too fast for them.  Base Reality: There is no base reality here at all except for an opinion. Base before comedy. It is so much easier to add the comedy after the base reality is established than it is to add the base after the comedy is established (or better said, attempted to be establishhed because it often isn't funny without the context of the base reality. Overall, a unique and intriguing initiation with a clear comedic direction. First adding context about the setting and relationship would have helped it a lot."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'windshield' : 'You've been helping my dental practice from the front desk so much Stephen. It's like you are running interference for me.'", "completion": "Your initiation line establishes a clear relationship and an attitude of appreciation. Here are a few points of feedback: Base Reality: You've established a professional relationship (dentist and front desk assistant) and the setting (dental practice) effectively. Opinion & Appreciation: The line expresses appreciation, which sets a positive tone and gives the scene a strong emotional foundation, ie a deeper base. A Gift: By defining an important aspect of Stephen's character, you have given what is known as a 'Gift' in improv. Your partner can now play with this gift to further define your relationship and build the scene.  Few things are as good or generous in improv as giving a 'Gift'.  Overall, a strong initiation with a clear relationship, setting, and positive tone. Good decision to give a gift."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'archeology' : 'I can't make heads or tails of all these bones at the dig site. I'm a new archeologist and I guess a dumb one to boot.'", "completion": "This initiation has a clear setting (a dig site) and a clear identity for the character (a new archeologist). However, it includes a negative opinion about the character's intelligence and implies a conflict (or problem) with their own competence. Here are some notes for improvement: No FirsT Day On The Job Scenes: This is to avoid the very trap this initiation falls into. Scenes about someon's first day on the job invariably feature that character messing up and all these scenes end up feeling very similar. A pilot messing up feels like a chef messing up feels like a magician messing up. Sure some of the details and dynamics may change with professions but the larger dynamic is the same.   Top Of Your Intelligence: You should play all your caracters as if they are just as smart as you are. No one likes to watch improvisers act dumb and dumb scenes end up feeling very similar to first-day-on-the-job scenes. Dumb mechanic feels like dumb surgeon feels like dumb father. An interesting initiation wit lots of pitfalls. Try saying someting about your scene partner next time."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'aunt' : 'aunt	Ante Up, Ante Up, Dems your cards.	37 sec'", "completion": "This initiation sets up a scene with a card game. It is a little jokey with the of 'ante' obviously inspired by the suggestion. Wouldn't suggest it as a common practice, but it was funny and caused no damage while helping to establish the base. Base Reality: We know who, where and what with just seven words. Good job."
}

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'compost' : 'You're the worst roommate! Your hair smells like compost!'", "completion": "This initiation starts with a conflict and a negative statement, which can be challenging for building a positive, collaborative scene. Additionally, it focuses on a problem even while  establishing a clear relationship and likely setting. Avoid starting with conflict: Begin with a neutral or positive statement to set a collaborative tone. Clarify the relationship: Establish who the characters are to each other beyond just being roommates."

{"prompt": "Can you give feedback on the following improv initiation based on the suggestion 'phone' : 'I was hoping someone could sell me a phone charger in this Verizon store?'", "completion": "This initiation sets a clear location (a Verizon store) and a clear 'what' (looking for a phone charger). However, it lacks a real relationship. Here are some notes for improvement: Base Reality: Good job establishing the Who, Where & What with just a few words.Nothing inherently wrong with them but for beginners in particular transactions scenes often hit a roadblock. As in, 'I would like to buy some toothpaste.' 'Here you go tat's $3.' 'Here you go.' Is there any reason for this scene to continue now? Question: The way the initiation is structured it is almost a question which invites conflict and/or unwanted surprises."
