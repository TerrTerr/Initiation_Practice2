    "prompt": "Can you give feedback on the below improv initiation(s): 'I can drink a gallon of milk every morning,'",
    "completion": " Your initiation line, "I can drink a gallon of milk every morning," sets up a specific and unique character trait and that's about it. You might think it provides a "what" (Drinking milk) but remember this is something that happens in the morning and not now by implication. 
Here are a few points of feedback:

Character & Opinion: You've established a character with a unique habit, which can be explored further but which migt also be too much to handle this early in the scene. Depending on the experience level of your scene partner you might want to consider starting with more mundane elements of the base, instead of only a comedic caracteristic. 
Relationship & Setting: The line lacks context about where the scene is happening or the relationship between the characters. Adding these elements can make the initiation more grounded and relatable.
Conflict-Free: It's a conflict-free statement, which is good. It leaves room for your scene partner to build on the information.
Overall, an interesting start that would probably benefit from more details about the base reality."
